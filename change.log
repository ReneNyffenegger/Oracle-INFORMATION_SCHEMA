     Version 0.1b (René Nyffeengger)
        Adding minimal support for
           triggers,
           table_constraints
        so as to make it possible to migrate Oracle to MySQL
        with MySQL workbench
        It turns out, the Workbench python scripts use as
        for table aliases which is not supported by Oracle.
        Oh well…
